```
brew install python
```

Ubuntu 

```
sudo apt-get install python
sudo apt-get install python-pip
```

### Install node if you haven't already

Mac

```

## Defining a function

A function has inputs and an output. The inputs are known as the "arguments", and the output is known as a "return value"

below is an example of a function in python

```
def multiply(a,b):
	return a * b
```

this is an example of the same function in  javascript

```
function multiply(a,b) { 
	return (a * b)
}
```

This function takes two arguments (a and b), and returns the value of them multiplied together

##  Calling a function

In the above exercise you have simply defined a function, but you haven't asked python to call it. If you ran the program above, you wouldn't see any output in the terminal.

```
# This part of the code defines a function
def multiply(a,b):
	return a * b

# This part of the code then calls that function and assigns the variable x to its return value
x = multiply(8,9)

# This prints x to the terminal for humans to read
print x
```

in JavaScript that would look like this

```
# This part of the code defines a function
function multiply(a,b) { 
	return (a * b)
}

# This part of the code then calls that function and assigns the variable x to its return value
var x = multiply(8,9)

# This prints x to the terminal for humans to read
console.log(x)
```

## Return vs Print

The function can also contain other logic and do other things. For example, you could write the function above like this:

```
def multiply(a,b):
	print "I'm multiplying two numbers"
	return  a * b
```

This would both print to the terminal and return a value. The return is the very last logical thing that happens in the execution of a function. Once a `return` is called, no additional code can be run inside the function. The same is true in JavaScript (and all programming languages).

## Try It
1. create a new branch in your `python-playground` git repo called "calculator"
2. inside that branch create a new file called `calculator.py`

3. Write a program that defines four functions (multiply, add, subtract, and divide). These functions should not print anything, they should simply perform a mathematical operation on the two arguments and return the value.

4. Commit to git `git commit -m "add functions to calculator"`and push the change to github.  `git push`

5. At the bottom of the file, Call the function and print a line explaining what is happening. Like this:
	
	```
	print "I'm going use the calculator functions to multiply 5 and 6"
	x = multiply(5,6)
	print x
	```
	
6. Commit this change and explain what you just did in the commit message

7. Run the file with the following command to make sure your python is all right:

	```
	python calculator.py
	```

8. Make sure everything works correctly and issue a pull request on github back to the master branch with a message explaining what changes you made in this branch.

9. Accept the pull request into the master branch and delete the `calculator` branch on github.

10. Checkout the master branch, and pull the version of master with the calculator branch merged
	```
	git checkout master
	git pull
	```
	
11. Delete your local version of the calculator branch
	```
	git branch -D calculator
	```
**bonus**

1. Add two more functions, square and cube.
2. Make a function called square_n_times that takes two arguments, number and n. square the number n times and return the result.

## Try It

1. create a new branch in your `python-playground` git repo called "js-calculator"
2. inside that branch create a new file called `calculator.js`

3. Write (in javascript) a program that defines four functions (multiply, add, subtract, and divide). These functions should not print anything, they should simply perform a mathematical operation on the two arguments and return the value.

4. Commit to git `git commit -m "add functions to calculator"`and push the change to github.  `git push`

5. At the bottom of the file, Call the function and print a line explaining what is happening. Like this:
	
	```
	console.log("I'm going use the calculator functions to multiply 5 and 6")
	var x = multiply(5,6)
	console.log(x)
	```
	
6. Commit this change and explain what you just did in the commit message

7. Run the file with the following command to make sure your python is all right:

	```
	node calculator.js
	```

8. Make sure everything works correctly and issue a pull request on github back to the master branch with a message explaining what changes you made in this branch.

9. Accept the pull request into the master branch and delete the `js-calculator` branch on github.

10. Checkout the master branch, and pull the version of master with the calculator branch merged
	```
	git checkout master
	git pull
	```
	
11. Delete your local version of the js-calculator branch
	```
	git branch -D js-calculator
	```
