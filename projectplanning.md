# Project Planning

Your project will involve creating a webpage where you visualize one or more datasets in order to tell a story about or make a case for something in your area of policy interest.

In order to do this you will need to select one or more datasets and visualizations. Please do collaborate with your team-mates on slack in finding a dataset you want to communicate, but make sure you have one distinct set of data and one distinct visualization minimum per team member. I ask that each team member contribute one pre-planning exercise. You may not use all of them in your final project, but this will provide you with a few options to start from.

## Find a relevant dataset

http://data.gov is a good place to start, but you're welcome to consider datasets from other places as well. Depending on the expertise on your team and your level of comfort with different data formats, it would be best to look for data that is either in a simple JSON structure or a CSV file.

## Find an appropriate visualization

Lets harness the power of [Data Driven Documents](https://d3js.org/) and aim for something beyond a simple line chart. For example, if I wanted to visualize the united states budget, I may consider using a bubble chart like this one:
https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063269

## Data manipulation

The end goal will be to take the example visualization, and feed it data to fit your needs. Start thinking about the following

### Technical Concepts

1. Back end

   - Collect the data at its source in either JSON or CSV

   - Write code (or find another way) to manipulate the original data into the JSON or CSV format that the visualization is looking for.

2. Front End

  - You will also need to clean up the front-end code provided in the example visualization. You will split it up into its component parts (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) in separate files.

  - You will need to arrange the charts, the text, and other components of the page (or pages) in an aesthetically pleasing way and write new styles so that your page does not look barren.

## Scrum Artifacts

You will have to submit SCRUM artifacts including but not limited to, a Trello board, a burn-down chart, and user stories as well as your reflection on your groups adherence to agile values.

## Using Github

You will collaborate on GitHub. I hope to see commits from all the team members. Branching is encouraged, forking is un-necessary.

## Conclusion
More details coming soon. This should give you a general sense of what the project will be like. Each member should take some time tonight to (1) find a dataset or two (2) find a visualization or two and (3) think through what it is going to take to join that dataset to the visualization that will work best for it.
