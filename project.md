# Project

## Summary
For the final project, you will work in a scrum-inspired team with a group of your classmates to create a dynamic web application around a dataset of your choice.

Remember to keep your processes agile. This means you team will value:

**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

**Working software** over comprehensive documentation

**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

**Responding to change** over following a plan

## Product

### Roles
Appoint a scrum master, a project owner, and team members.

### Daily Scrum Meeting

Your team will hold a daily scrum meeting. These stand-up meetings can be as brief or as long as you need, although remember, the scrum meeting is intended to be short and is frequently done standing up for this purpose. You don't have to resolve your problems during scrum, just surface them and resolve them with only the parties that need to be present either online or offline. 

Remember, one of the twelve principles of agile development is:

>"The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation."
[- 12 Principles Behind Agile Manifesto](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/)

Since Agile development prioritizes individuals and interactions over processes and tools, and highly values face to face conversations, the scrum meeting must be either in person or via video conference. If you think video conferences are not working, you can make a quick pivot to in-person meetings.

### User Stories

Your team will create a handful of "users", in this case, people who would be interseted in viewing the information you will be serving up in your app. You will submit a short description of who each of these users are.

Along with the users, you will submit a few "User Stories". Some of the user stories may be outside of the scope of the project, but think of your submission of this project as just the first sprint of a larger project. Feel free to create user stories with functionality that is beyond the scope of our class. (For example, modifying the database is not something we will do in this exercise, but you're welcome to create a user story that would require that functionality in order to address)

>As a ____ 
>
>I want ____ 
>
>so that ____. 

### Sprint Planning
Your team will hold a sprint-planning meeting at the start of the project period. This meeting will be split into two parts as described in "SCRUM: A Breathtakingly Breif and Agile Introduction". Re-read the section on sprint planning before starting this meeting.

During the first part of the meeting the team will collectively decide how much they think they can accomplish.

During the second part, you will break the stories down into tasks and put them on a trello board. Everyone on the team will assign tasks to themselves. This will involve a round of scrum "poker".
