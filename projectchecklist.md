# Project Checklist

Hello everyone! I hope you all found the projects instructive and enjoyable. Diving into new technologies can be both disorienting and rewarding. Learning new programming skills is often a cyclical process of getting stuck and unstuck. It is not uncommon to get lost in rabbit-holes of debugging or reading about technologies in an attempt to unpack how exactly they work.

Learning how to learn programming by searching the web for relevant resources, reading technical discussions and forums, and testing out example code snippets, as well as leaning on other programmers and knowing who to call when you're stuck are themselves important skills: skills which many of you got a chance to explore in attempts to customize your visualizations (many of you even decided to customize the JavaScript to change the behavior of the visualizations, which was not at all required for the project so kudos to those who tried!). 

In order to help you on your final stretch of the project I have created the following checklist of submission items:

## Checklist
- [ ] Final Project [Front-End](project.md#building-a-front-end) Repo
- [ ] Final Project [Back-End](project.md#building-a-back-end) Repo
- [ ] Trello Board (with team members assigned to tasks they did)
- [ ] [User Stories](https://github.com/dmil/hks-coursework/blob/master/project.md#user-stories)
- [ ] Burn-down chart showing number of "points" accomplished between each scrum meeting
- [ ] Some kind of record of your scrum meetings
- [ ] A record of your [sprint retrospective](project.md#retrospective) 
- [ ] Link to your final project webpage on github pages

Please refer back to the [project.md](project.md) file for details on what each deliverable should look like.

## Sprit Retrospecive
Your final meeting with your team is a retrospective. Please submit a few retrospective items (shown below) naming things the team should start, stop, and continue doing during the "next sprint" if this was an ongoing project. If it is too difficult to coordinate another meeting with your team, feel free to have the discussion over slack and compile a few bullet points for each.


> Each team member is asked to identify specific things that the team should:
>
> Start doing
>
> Stop doing
>
> Continue doing

## Submitting the Project

When you're ready to submit the project, please create a new github issue in your front-end repository called "Ready for Review" with links to all of the items in the checklist.

In your team's slack channel, post a link, to that issue and mention @dhrumil letting me know that the project is submitted and ready for my review.

I will review the project and send back comments and a grade over the course of the coming week.

## Extensions

If you think your team needs additional time, I'm willing to grant an extension until Sunday night or Monday morning. Please **let me know** if you think your team needs more time and won't be able to meet the originally set Friday due date so that I know when to expect a submission.

## Help

If you need any help, I will be on Slack all of Saturday and Sunday and am also willing to Skype if you need guidance resolving any particular problems. Please don't hesitate to reach out.

## Course Evaluations

You should have recieved an email about the course evaluations, they are accessible through the [canvas page for this class](https://canvas.harvard.edu/) and are **due on Thursday Jan 26**. As you know, this is the first time this module was offered at HKS and a completely new curriculem. Your honest feedback will be particularly important both in helping me understand how to best improve the course as well as helping the Kennedy School better undertand the role of technical educaiton in the curriculem. Please take some time to thoughtfully fill out the course evaluation, your feedback is of particular importance in the context of this module.
