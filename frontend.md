## Try It (Together)

We're going to Build a webpage that visualizes data

https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3902569

### Bonus
Add two buttons to your page, one to show the chart and one to hide it

### Super duper bonus
Make those into one button that toggles show/hide of the chart

## Note

Some of these pre-created D3 visualizations take in CSV format (like the simple example that we did above). Others take in a JSON format. We will be a good chunk of tomorrow practicing conversions between CSV and JSON formats using python, which will hopefully open up for your project

  11. any D3 visualization that takes input as CSV or JSON (most of them)
  2. any data source that outputs data as CSV or JSON

If you find that you want to use a data visualization, but are not sure how to connect the dataset to the visualization, have someone in your project group chat with me, I'm happy to help you learn how to connect any particular visualization to any particular dataset (JSON or CSV).
