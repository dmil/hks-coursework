# Working with Data in Python (Hacks)

There are more "correct" or conventional ways to work with data in python. If you've ever used R or STATA for statistical programming, you might want to checkout [pandas](pandas.pydata.org). This introduces the concept of a "dataframe", we're not going to do that though.

Here some rather unconventional, or as programmers call it "hacky" ways to go from JSON to CSV.

## CSV Mapper

in your terminal, install csv Mapper
```
pip install csvmapper
```
